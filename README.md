### 2. Use Professional Badges for Links

Instead of plain text links, use badges. They are clean, professional, and a standard in the tech community.

**Replace your "How to reach me" line with this:**

```markdown
<p align="left">
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashim-dhor/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" alt="LinkedIn"></a>
  <a href="mailto:ashim21@iiserb.ac.in"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Gmail-D14836?style=for-the-badge&logo=gmail&logoColor=white" alt="Gmail"></a>
</p>



### Hi there, I'm Ashim Dhor 👋

I am a Data Science and Engineering student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, with a passion for applying machine learning to solve real-world problems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing trustworthy Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for high-stakes cancer diagnostics at the **Biomedical Data Science Lab**.
- 🌱 I’m exploring the intersection of Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, particularly in the domain of fraud detection.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to deep learning, computer vision, and quantum machine learning.
